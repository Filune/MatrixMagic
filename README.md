# MatrixMagic
MatrixMagic allows users to perform operations on square matrices. The available operations are matrix multiplication, finding the transpose, addition/subtraction, and finding the determinant.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to weave together linear algebra, structs, and dynamic memory management within C.

## Usage
1. Download and extract the contents of this repository into a new MagicMatrix directory.
2. Make sure a C compiler is installed.
3. Run `make` from a command line terminal inside the MatrixMagic directory.
4. Run `./MatrixMagic` inside the same directory as in step 2.
