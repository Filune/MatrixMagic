# MatrixMagic
MatrixMagic allows users to perform operations on square matrices. The available operations are matrix multiplication, finding the transpose, addition/subtraction, and finding the determinant.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to weave together linear algebra, structs, and dynamic memory management within C.

## Usage
To run the program, first run `make` from a command line terminal inside the MatrixMagic directory. Then, run `./MatrixMagic`.
